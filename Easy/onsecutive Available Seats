Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats. 
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?

| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |

Note:

The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool (‘1’ means free, and ‘0’ means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

SOLUTION:

SELECT DISTINT t1.seat_id FROM cinema AS t1 JOIN cinema AS t2
ON ABS(t1.seat_id-2,t2.seat_id) =1
WHERE t1.free ='1' AND t2.free = 1
ORDER BY t1.seat_id
